✅ Critical Pre-Launch Checklist
🧪 1. Tag Submission Validation
 ✅ Profanity filter is working (confirmed in validateTagName)

 ⚠️ Add a rate limit for tag submissions per user (e.g. 1 every 10 seconds or 10/day)

 ⚠️ Prevent duplicate tags differing only by capitalization or spacing

👤 2. User Accounts & Permissions
 ✅ Users must verify email before interacting

 ✅ Roles are enforced: only admins can access /admin-panel, etc.

 ⚠️ Add user-facing feedback if banned (e.g. “You’ve been banned”)

 ⚠️ Add password reset (if not already in your roadmap)

🧼 3. Tag Display & Behavior
 ✅ Only approved tags are shown in popup

 ⚠️ Add ability to sort/filter tags on cards (e.g. alphabetical?)

 ⚠️ Optional: limit how many tags are shown before "expand more" button appears

🛡️ 4. Abuse Mitigation
 ⚠️ Add rate limiting middleware to sensitive routes (tag submission, login, etc.)

 ⚠️ Store IP address (or device fingerprint) for aggressive tag spammers

🔧 5. Admin/Mod Tools
 ✅ Admin can edit tags, change status, and delete

 ✅ Moderator hub can approve/deny submissions

 ⚠️ Add search/filter in admin tag manager (by user, tag, cardId, etc.)

 ⚠️ View recent tag submissions by a specific user (e.g. on profile page)

🎨 6. Visual / UI Polish
 ⚠️ Add “loading...” indicators on all major fetches (dashboard, mod queue)

 ⚠️ Ensure full mobile responsiveness (test on phone!)

 ⚠️ Add favicon, logo, and site title

🧹 7. Code & Performance
 ⚠️ Remove unused routes and legacy code (/api/newtags/:cardId using old Tag model is now gone — good!)

 ⚠️ Review console logs — remove sensitive output before launch

 ⚠️ Compress image assets if needed (lazy load future card popups?)
